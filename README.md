### Benchmark used : [Moving AI Lab](https://www.movingai.com/benchmarks/grids.html)                 
40 images   
Each image is a closed space that has many room with doors where each pixel (square) has a color of:      
* [  0   0   0] Black  and  [ 0 127 0 ] Green  is an occupied (obstacle)
* [ 229 229 229 ] Grey is an not occupied (free)
