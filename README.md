### Benchmark used : [Moving AI Lab](https://www.movingai.com/benchmarks/room/index.html)                  
40 images   
Each image is a closed space that has many room with doors where each pixel (square) having the color of:      
* [  0   0   0] Black  or  [ 0 127 0 ] Green  is an occupied cell (obstacle)
* [ 229 229 229 ] Grey is not  an occupied cell (free)
